**NOTE:** *This web app has been developed with the help of ChatGPT and DeepThink R1. I am a learner and have learned a lot from this project!*

**DISCLAIMER:** *This is just a game for kids who want to play a banking game. It does not involve real-life transactions or financial fraud.*

## 🛠 Installation & Setup

### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nitingaming-india/bank.git
cd bank
```

### 2️⃣ Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3️⃣ Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your MongoDB URI:

```env
MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
```

### 4️⃣ Create Uploads Directory

Ensure there is an `uploads` folder in the root directory to store user documents:

```bash
mkdir uploads
```

### 5️⃣ Run the Application

```bash
node app.js
```

Your app should now be live at: `http://localhost:3000`

### 6️⃣ Set Up Admin Account

To create an admin account, run:

```bash
node ad.js
```

This will insert an admin user into the database. You can modify `ad.js` to set your own credentials:

```js
const createAdminUser = async () => {
  const adminUser = {
    username: 'your_admin_username',
    password: 'your_secure_password', // Will be hashed automatically
    role: 'admin',
  };
```
